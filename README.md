Greetings,
Kari here. I'm insane and student too. During studying (haha ...dying....dying too ) Java and C# last 2 years I switched and tried to go deeper with the knowledge i had thanks to my dear lector Thdr. Pink. That's how i came to C++ and C. Hopefully I'll finish da school this year and pass the finals....I mean....Pinkler got fired and now we have teacher Mr. Rich that is absolutely awesome and cool too. He's one of the reasons i haven't quit the programming yet ...( {

nobody: 
Pinkler: "have anyone heard about the pope that was behind the number of days in month February? Nobody? Welp....lemme explain it..."

})

No needs for explanation...that's how it went...for...most of the time....aanyhoo
